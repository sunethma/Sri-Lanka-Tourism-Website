<h1 id="topic">Introduction</h1>

<P id="paragraph">The words "Sri Lanka" conjure up images of gorgeous beaches, sunsets, tea, and cricket teams.
    Visitors to Sri Lanka come for the tropical sunsets, but they stay for the food.
    <br>
    <br>
    Sri Lankan cuisine is unique. Sri Lankan cuisine, with its fragrant spices and brilliant colors,
    makes you feel cheerful, warm, and content.
    Nothing beats a hearty dinner of rice and curry for a native Sri Lankan.
    So much so that when most Sri Lankans travel overseas, they insist on bringing jars of homemade curry or seasonings with them.
    <br>
    <br>

    Sri Lankan food is noted for its unique blends of herbs, spices, seafood, vegetables, rices, and fruits.
    Many types of rice are used in the cuisine,
    as well as coconut, which is a common plant across the nation.
    Seafood, whether fresh or preserved, plays an important role in the cuisine. Contact with foreign traders,
    as a country that served as a center on the ancient maritime silk route,
    introduced new culinary products and cultural influences, in addition to the country's ethnic groups' unique customs,
    all of which have influenced Sri Lankan cuisine.
    Sri Lankan cuisine is heavily influenced by Indian (especially South Indian), Indonesian, and Dutch cuisines, with close
    relations to other South and Southeast Asian countries.
    <br>
    <br>
    Other than that The multi-cultural aspect of Sri Lanka is one of the reasons why it is a great destination for travelers and
    foodies. Sri Lankan cuisine is a synthesis of several culinary items from the country's many ethnicities. Each ethnic group
    in Sri Lanka contributes to the country's cuisine in its own way. Foods like kiribath (milk rice) and a variety of
    celebratory sweets like kavum, kokis, and aluwa are popular among Sinhalese. The Tamil community contributes a variety of
    delectable dishes such as dosai, idly, wadei, murukku, and sweets such as kesari, jalebi, and laddoo, among others.
    Foods such as faluda, biryani, and wattalapam have their origins in the Muslim minority of Sri Lanka.
    <br>
    <br>
    Street food is a must that should be talked about when talking about the Sri lankan cuisine.Kottu can be regarded as one
    of the most defining food items when talking about the street food of Sri lanka.Also a variety of food items such as patties,
    cutlets, Chinese rolls, maalu paan (fish buns), and various
    types of pastries, short eats are always there when you need a snack with your evening tea or a quick breakfast in the morning.
    <br>
    <br>
    Given the diverse range of flavors and textures found in Sri Lankan cuisine, there is no doubt that it is a fantastic
    gastronomical trip. Sri Lanka provides a distinct and flavorful cuisine experience to all visitors, from upscale dining
    places to roadside cafes and street food sellers. By visiting Sri Lanka, you will be able to sample the food of not one,
    but four distinct civilizations,
    all of which mingle together to create a cuisine that can only be described as genuinely Sri Lankan.
